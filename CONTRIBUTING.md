All patches are welcome. Feel free to even suggest some catch and funny titles for the existing Examples. I really want to make this collection as interesting to read as possible.

If the changes you suggest are siginificant, filing an issue before submitting the actual patch will be appreciated. If you'd like to work on the issue (highly encouraged), you can mention that you're interested in working on it while creating the issue and get assigned to it.

If you're adding a new example, please do create an issue to discuss it before submitting a patch.

You can use the following template for adding a new example:

<pre>
### Some fancy Title

```py
# Setting up the code.
# Preparation for the magic...
```

**Output (Python version):**
```py
>>> triggering_statement
Probably unexpected output
```
(Optional): One line describing the unexpected output.

**Note:** All the examples mentioned below are run on Python 3.5.2 interactive interpreter unless explicitly specified.


#### 💡 Explanation:
* Brief explanation of what's happening and why is it happening.
  ```py
  Setting up examples for clarification (if necessary)
  ```
  **Outupt:**
  ```py
  >>> trigger # some example that makes it easy to unveil the magic
  # some justified output
  ```
```
</pre>
