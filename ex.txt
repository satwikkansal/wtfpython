i = 0
while i<=5:
  print(i,end=' ')
  i += 1
else:
  print(i,end=' ')
  
  OUTPUT:
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6
  
  
  Most langauges do not allow an else statement without an if. 
  However, python allows the else statement to be executed without the if provided the loop before it has not been terminated by a break statement.
