Some examples are read-only because, \n- they either require a version of Python that's not supported in the hosted runtime.\n- or they can't be reproduced in the notebook envrinonment.\n\nThe expected outputs are already present in collapsed cells following the code cells. The Google colab provides Python2 (2.7) and Python3 (3.6, default) runtimes. You can switch among these for Python2 specific examples. For examples specific to other minor versions, you can simply refer to collapsed outputs (it's not possible to control the minor version in hosted notebooks as of now). You can check the active version using\n\n```py\n>>> import sys\n>>> sys.version\n# Prints out Python version here.\n```\n\nThat being said, most of the examples do work as expected. If you face any trouble, feel free to consult the original content on wtfpython and create an issue in the repo. Have fun!\n\n---\n"

        "#### \ud83d\udca1 Explanation:\n",
        "+ The behavior in first and second snippets is due to a CPython optimization (called string interning) that tries to use existing immutable objects in some cases rather than creating a new object every time.\n",
        "+ After being \"interned,\" many variables may reference the same string object in memory (saving memory thereby).\n",
        "+ In the snippets above, strings are implicitly interned. The decision of when to implicitly intern a string is implementation-dependent. There are some rules that can be used to guess if a string will be interned or not:\n",
        "  * All length 0 and length 1 strings are interned.\n",
        "  * Strings are interned at compile time (`'wtf'` will be interned but `''.join(['w', 't', 'f'])` will not be interned)\n",
        "  * Strings that are not composed of ASCII letters, digits or underscores, are not interned. This explains why `'wtf!'` was not interned due to `!`. CPython implementation of this rule can be found [here](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.6/Objects/codeobject.c#L19)\n",
        "  ![image](/images/string-intern/string_intern.png)\n",
        "+ When `a` and `b` are set to `\"wtf!\"` in the same line, the Python interpreter creates a new object, then references the second variable at the same time. If you do it on separate lines, it doesn't \"know\" that there's already `\"wtf!\"` as an object (because `\"wtf!\"` is not implicitly interned as per the facts mentioned above). It's a compile-time optimization. This optimization doesn't apply to 3.7.x versions of CPython (check this [issue](https://github.com/satwikkansal/wtfpython/issues/100) for more discussion).\n",
        "+ A compile unit in an interactive environment like IPython consists of a single statement, whereas it consists of the entire module in case of modules. `a, b = \"wtf!\", \"wtf!\"` is single statement, whereas `a = \"wtf!\"; b = \"wtf!\"` are two statements in a single line. This explains why the identities are different in `a = \"wtf!\"; b = \"wtf!\"`, and also explain why they are same when invoked in `some_file.py`\n",
        "+ The abrupt change in the output of the fourth snippet is due to a [peephole optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peephole_optimization) technique known as Constant folding. This means the expression `'a'*20` is replaced by `'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'` during compilation to save a  few clock cycles during runtime. Constant folding only occurs for strings having a length of less than 21. (Why? Imagine the size of `.pyc` file generated as a result of the expression `'a'*10**10`). [Here's](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.6/Python/peephole.c#L288) the implementation source for the same.\n",
        "+ Note: In Python 3.7, Constant folding was moved out from peephole optimizer to the new AST optimizer with some change in logic as well, so the fourth snippet doesn't work for Python 3.7. You can read more about the change [here](https://bugs.python.org/issue11549). \n",

If you concatenate four strings of length 10, you'll be copying (10+10) + ((10+10)+10) + (((10+10)+10)+10) = 90 characters instead of just 40 characters. Things get quadratically worse as the number and size of the string increases (justified with the execution times of `add_bytes_with_plus` function)\n",

        "+ CPython is able to reuse the same \"keys\" object in multiple dictionaries. This was added in [PEP 412](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0412/) with the motivation to reduce memory usage, specifically in dictionaries of instances - where keys (instance attributes) tend to be common to all instances.\n",
        "+ This optimization is entirely seamless for instance dictionaries, but it is disabled if certain assumptions are broken.\n",
        "+ Key-sharing dictionaries do not support deletion; if an instance attribute is deleted, the dictionary is \"unshared\", and key-sharing is disabled for all future instances of the same class.\n",
        "+ Additionaly, if the dictionary keys have be resized (because new keys are inserted), they are kept shared *only* if they are used by a exactly single dictionary (this allows adding many attributes in the `__init__` of the very first created instance, without causing an \"unshare\"). If multiple instances exist when a resize happens, key-sharing is disabled for all future instances of the same class: CPython can't tell if your instances are using the same set of attributes anymore, and decides to bail out on attempting to share their keys.\n",
        "+ A small tip, if you aim to lower your program's memory footprint: don't delete instance attributes, and make sure to initialize all attributes in your `__init__`!\n",
